# Machine Anomaly Detection and Hardware Failure Prediction Demo

## Overview

This demo application leverages machine learning techniques to detect anomalies in machine data and predict potential hardware failures. The application consists of a front-end built with React for user interaction and a back-end model implemented in Python using the Isolation Forest algorithm from the `scikit-learn` library.

## Technologies Used

- **Front-End**: 
  - React.js
  - PapaParse (for CSV parsing)
  - CSS (for styling)

- **Back-End**: 
  - Python
  - Pandas (for data manipulation)
  - Scikit-Learn (for anomaly detection)
  - Matplotlib (optional, for visualization)
